# acute_kidney_failure_prediction
This project aims to predict acute kidney failure in patients with Rabdomiolisis. The model uses medical data from MIMIC IV database in order to determine the probability of an ICU patient with Rabdomiolisis of developing acute kidney failure in order to early detect and treat this potentially deadly scenario.
